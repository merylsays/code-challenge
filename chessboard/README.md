Write a program that creates a string that represents an 8x8 grid, using new line characters to seperate lines. At each position of the grid there is either a space or a # character. The characters should form a chessboard.

Passing the string to ```console.log``` should show something like this:

```
  # # # #
# # # #
  # # # #
# # # #
  # # # #
# # # #
  # # # #
# # # #
```

When you have a program that generates this pattern, define a binding ```size = 8``` and change the program so that it works for any size, outputting a grid of the given width and height.
